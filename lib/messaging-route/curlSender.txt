####### SEND Notification from Firebase console:    based on FCM token,  app name, or. topic subscriptions
For testing purposes, the simplest way to send a notification is via the Firebase Console. Make sure to include click_action: FLUTTER_NOTIFICATION_CLICK as a "Custom data" key-value-pair (under "Advanced options") when targeting an Android device. 

The Firebase Console does not support sending data messages.
